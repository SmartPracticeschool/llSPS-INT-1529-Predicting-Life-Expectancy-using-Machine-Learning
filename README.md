        **Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning**
              Life Expectancy is one of the most important factor in end-of-life decision making.
  Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time of human being is expected to live.
  As if average time of human being is expected to live can be calculated then we can predict the 
  average rate of life expectancy of country.Life expectancy depends on various factors like Regional
  variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differances, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses,Education,
  Year of their birth and other demographic factors. In this project life expectancy rate of country
  will be predicted. 
                In this project various factors such as  GDP, education, alocohol intake people of in the
   country , expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the 
   country are considered as input . By using this factors rate of life expectancy of country will be predicted.
   This project will help to country to know their rate of life expectancy, which factors affects more to decrease
   life expectancy so that they can take appropriate decision to increase life expectancy of human being in their country.
